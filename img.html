<!-- Explanation of Attributes:
src: Specifies the path to the image file. This is a required attribute.
alt: Provides alternative text for the image if it cannot be displayed. This is a required attribute for accessibility.
title: Offers additional information about the image, which appears as a tooltip when the user hovers over the image.
width: Sets the width of the image (in pixels).
height: Sets the height of the image (in pixels).
longdesc: Provides a link to a detailed description of the image (this attribute is not widely supported and can be omitted if not needed).
srcset: Allows the browser to choose the appropriate image source based on the device's screen size and resolution.
sizes: Defines the sizes of images to be used based on the viewport size. It works in conjunction with srcset.
loading: Controls when the image should be loaded. lazy defers loading the image until it is needed.
decoding: Specifies how the image should be decoded. async allows the browser to decode the image asynchronously.
crossorigin: Configures how to handle cross-origin requests for the image. anonymous means no credentials are sent.
usemap: Associates the image with a <map> element for client-side image maps. -->
