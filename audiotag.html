<!-- 
The <audio> tag in HTML is used to embed audio files in a web page. It supports several attributes to control its behavior. Here's a breakdown of the attributes you can use:

  src: Specifies the URL of the audio file.
  controls: Adds basic playback controls (play, pause, volume).
  autoplay: Starts playing the audio as soon as it is ready.
  loop: Makes the audio start over again, every time it is finished.
  muted: Mutes the audio by default.
  preload: Specifies how the audio file should be loaded when the page loads. Options are:
  auto: The browser should preload the audio file.
  metadata: Only the metadata (e.g., duration) should be preloaded.
  none: The audio file should not be preloaded. -->
